# LDS-prefetcher-research
This project is major in design a new algorithm mainly reducing load_to_use latency of linked data structure in high performance procesor 

Backgroud:
*******In recent years, people find that the long latency can't be covered by common stride_based prefetcher, 
*******and propose a lot of algorithm designed for prefetch linked data structure, whicn is hard for common prefetcher to
*******prefetch. While most of the reseachers either find a HW/SW cooperative way, or a hardware-cost method.
*******Here, I will propose a low-hw-cost and memory bandwidth effective, high prediction accuracy LDS prefetcher.
     
MY first computer architecture reseach based on GEM5.
After exams, I will edit more document for this project to make it readable.
